# Project-1-Final-Submission
## Problem Statement: Does encouraging more students to take tests result in improved scores?
This project aims to analyze the relationship between the participation rates in the SAT and ACT exams and the resulting average test scores. Specifically, it seeks to answer the question: Does encouraging more students to take standardized tests result in improved scores

### Key Questions:
- Correlation Analysis:
Is there a significant relationship between the participation rate in SAT/ACT exams and the average test scores? (Does increased participation lead to lower average scores?)

- Test-Optional Policy Trend:
Analyze the trend of test-optional policies among popular U.S. universities.

## Outcomes and Recommendations:
**Higher Participation & Improved Outcomes**: By providing tailored academic support, especially to underrepresented students, we can potentially increase both participation rates and test scores, thereby reducing disparities in college admissions.
**Barriers to Test Participation**: Consider reducing or eliminating barriers such as high test fees and a lack of access to preparatory resources.

## Final Thought:
While standardized tests remain a significant factor in university admissions, there is ongoing debate about their true value. Research suggests that standardized tests may not fully capture a student's potential, and their use may have both positive and negative impacts in the long run. As the landscape of higher education continues to evolve, universities may need to reassess their reliance on SAT/ACT scores.
